<h2>The Royal Persian Angora Chinchilla</h2>
<p>The Royal Persian Angora Chinchilla (Angora for short) is estimated to have been developed around the early 1960's at a ranch in Fort Worth, Texas. They were originally considered for the pelt industry due to their quick maturation of 5 months (chinchillas usually hit maturity around 8-9 months) but were disregarded as a viable fur producer due to a problem with the fur being twice as long as other breeds and the clarity of the colour mutation proved difficult to produce. The Angora continued to be kept within selective chinchilla breeders of the pet industry and in 1997 two women purchased some of these chinchillas and spent a further 8 years heavily out-crossing the mutation to improve size, fur quality, temperament and subsequently named this breed of chinchilla The Royal Persian.</p>
