	<h1>Chinchilla</h1>
	<p>Chinchillas are crepuscular (most active around dawn and dusk) rodents, slightly larger and more robust than ground squirrels. They are native to the Andes mountains in South America and live in colonies called "herds" at high elevations up to 4,270 m (14,000 ft). Historically, chinchillas lived in an area that included parts of Bolivia, Peru, Argentina, and Chile, but today colonies in the wild are known only in Chile. Along with their relatives, viscachas, they make up the family Chinchillidae.</p>

	<h2>Name</h2>
	<p>The chinchilla (whose name literally means "little chincha") is named after the Chincha people of the Andes, who once wore its dense, velvet-like fur. By the end of the 19th century, chinchillas had become quite rare due to hunting for their ultra-soft fur. Most chinchillas currently used by the fur industry for clothing and other accessories are farm-raised. </p>

	<h3> There are 3 different breeds of wild chinchilla, these being:</h3>
	<ol>
		<li>The Lanigera Chinchilla</li>
		<li>The Brevicaudata Chinchilla</li>
		<li>The Costina Chinchilla (now unrecognised in today's industry)</li>
	</ol>

	<p>The Lanigera breed is the most commonly found chinchilla in the pet industry. They have a slimmer neckline and shoulders than the Brevicaudata and also have a slimmer head shape. Their tails are long, which gives the illusion that they are bigger than the Brevicaudata breed but in fact they are smaller. The Lanigera chinchilla can be found within the middle ranges of The Andes Mountains and their original colour mutation was light grey - brown.</p>
	<p>The Brevicaudata chinchilla has a broad neckline, rounder ears and a shorter tail than their cousins giving them a stockier appearance. Their nose is blunt giving their face a 'puggish' look and their fur is slightly longer and more wavy than all other breeds. Pure Brevicaudatas have a brownish sheen to their fur, which is denser to help keep them warm in their original habitat. Brevicaudata chinchillas live in the highest and coldest altitudes of The Andes Mountain Range, 15,000 feet above sea level.</p>
	<p>The Costina is the smallest size of the chinchillidae family. Although no longer recognised in the pet industry, they still existed so it shall be mentioned on this website. They have short fur, which is not as compact as the Lanigera or Brevicaudata breeds due to them not needing the extra warmth living in the lowest regions of the Andes Mountains of 3,000 feet about sea level. Costinas have a 'pointy' head shape leading to a 'rat-like' nose and have longer ears and tail than the other breeds. They are slightly more 'highly-strung' than their cousins and rarely found within the pet industry.</p>
